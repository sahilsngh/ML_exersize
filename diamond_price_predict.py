''' This model is trained on scilearn in python by Sahil Chauhan.
    In this model python uses its pandas library to extract the data_frame.
    The data_frame consist of more than 50k entries over time of features
    Diamond and also consist of its price in USD
    The data_frame is provided by "Shivam Agrawal" from "https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds"
